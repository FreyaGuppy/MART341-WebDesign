This website is about Doctor Who because I am very excited about the new episodes which are being released very soon and I cannot wait to watch them.

I used the Bulma farmework to build this site. I used some JavaScript but it was mostly copied from a tutorial. Using the framework made making a good looking website a lot easier. It was fun to figure out how to get the tabs to work.

I have given up on the home page at this point. I can't figure out a good use for the canvas.
