            “Hope” is the thing with feathers -<br />
            That perches in the soul -<br />
            And sings the tune without the words -<br />
            And never stops - at all -<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br />
            And sore must be the storm -<br />
            That could abash the little Bird<br />
            That kept so many warm -<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve heard it in the chillest land -<br />
            And on the strangest Sea -<br />
            Yet - never - in Extremity,<br />
            It asked a crumb - of me.
