        <p>
            I got my cat a HexBug and he loves playing with it. It is his new favorite toy, but I have to limit the amount of time he spends playing with it and keep an eye on him while he plays because I dont want him to lose it.

            As I write this, he is trying to shove it under the crack of my door. Which I have blocked off with a pair of pants for this very reason.
