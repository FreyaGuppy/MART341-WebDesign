People can't help but be drawn to your collection of vintage lunchboxes, and your talent for making origami frogs out of napkins is the stuff of legends. You tend to see the glass as not just half-empty, but completely drained. Sure, you may have a knack for predicting when the next big asteroid will hit, but let's not forget your killer dance moves when your favorite song comes on! Embrace your inner koala while pondering life's big questions - just don't forget to join the party every now and then!</td>

Which, was not my intention, i meant to make a simple 2x1 table to display the result. But I like how it looks now. So I'm just going to leave it.-->
